        ## My Interest Areas
        
        Most Initiatives and Projects are made up of several components, only
        some of which are *code*. If you are a coder (javascript, python, rust, sql, etc),
        that is great, but not required at all. We do use GitHub for initiative and component
        project management, so a willingness to interact with GitHub (as you are doing now) is
        a bare minimum… 

        **Note**: Our Whole Team approach means *Management* roles and responsibilities are shared,
        but it is always helpful to have at least one person keeping track of the details.
