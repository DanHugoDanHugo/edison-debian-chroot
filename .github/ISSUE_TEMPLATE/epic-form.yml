        # Agile Epic
        
        An Epic is a collection of related Features which combine to form a
        level of functionality within a larger project unit, here called a Theme
        (also called an Initiative by some).

        We can express an Epic directly as an Objective and Key Results (OKRs).

      value: |
        Issues should be linked by url (see info for issue linking bottom of page) for a
        variety of reasons, with tags in a task list indicating the link relationship.
        Identifying relationships between issues within the initiative hierarchy should
        be easier than without this information.

        Tags and Linked Issues
        - theme: -> the parent Theme in this Agile hierarchy for this Epic
        - feature: -> a child Feature in this Agile hierarchy for this Epic
        - merge-to: -> an Epic that is a merging of this and other Epic(s)
        - merge-from: -> an Epic that was merged into this Epic
        - split-to: -> an Epic that is one of multiple Themes derived from this Epic
        - split-from: -> an Epic that was split into this and other Epics
        - spike-to: -> a virtual Epic for planning and estimation of related Epics
        - spoke-from: --> a real Epic connected to a virtual spike Epic

        Merge-to and Split-to Epic issues should be closed in favor of the consolidated or expanded
        Epic issues, as appropriate. Do not delete them, mark as merge or split and closed.
