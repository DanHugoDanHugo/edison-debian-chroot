        # External Bug

        An external User or Customer may encounter a problem using or testing
        some element(s) of the Initiative in whatever form they have had access
        to it. We presume that a Bug Report may be filed externally and in fact
        completely outside of the GitHub user account universe, sent via email,
        or some other means, so that it may be ingested and stored in an Initiative-level
        *External Bug* before it can be triaged and split into actual Defects.

        One presumption is, an external User or Customer may not be familiar with the
        details of an Initiative, nor perhaps the specific Component Project to which a
        problem should be ascribed, so this is left to the internal Triage process.

        If at all possible, the original filer(s) of issues should be apprised of the
        status of their reported findings as they are addressed, and there is a case
        to be made for inclusion of filers of such reports as contributors to
        all or part of the Initiative (at their opt-in of course).

        Issues should be linked by url (see info for issue linking bottom of page) to indicate
        graph relationship between them, with tags in a task list indicating the link relationship.
        Identifying relationships between issues within the initiative hierarchy should
        be easier than without this information.

        Tags and Linked Issues
        - defect: --> a Defect Issue in a Component Project repo derived from this External Bug Report
        - feature: --> an Initiative Feature Issue derived from this External Bug report
        - story: --> an Initiative Story Issue derived from this External Bug Report

        External Bug issue(s) should be **Closed as Not Planned** after they are triaged and used to
        link to existing and/or create new Initiative Feature or User Story issue(s) and/or Defect Issue(s)
        in appropriate Component Project Repo(s).
