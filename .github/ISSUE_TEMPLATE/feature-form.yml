        # Agile Feature

        A **Feature** is a generalized behavior, experience, or expectation from a component of the Initiative.
        
        One or more User Stories will describe variations, subtleties, and specific considerations of a Feature,
        including potentially-required use of specific standard protocols, file formats, interfaces, and so on.

        We can describe a Feature directly as an **Objective** with measurable **Key Results** (OKRs).

    attributes:
      value: "# Feature Objective"

    id: objective
    attributes:
      label: A general description of some behavior, interface, experience, etc.
      description: To be described in specific detail with one or more User Stories…
      placeholder: A Feature might be an adjustable perpetual calendar, grouping more specific User Stories about month and year flipping, etc.

        Issues should be linked by url (see info for issue linking bottom of page) to indicate
        graph relationship between them, with tags in a task list indicating the link relationship.
        Identifying relationships between issues within the initiative hierarchy should
        be easier than without this information.

        Tags and Linked Issues
        - epic: -> a parent Epic in this Agile hierarchy for this Feature
        - story: -> a child User Story in this Agile Hierarchy for this Feature
        - merge-to: -> a Feature that is a merging of this and other Feature(s)
        - merge-from: -> a Feature that was merged into this Features
        - split-to: -> a Feature that is one of multiple Themes derived from this Features
        - split-from: -> a Feature that was split into this and other Features
        - spike-to: -> a virtual Feature for planning and estimation of related Features
        - spike-from: --> a real Theme connected to a virtual spike Theme

        Merge-to and Split-to Feature issue(s) should be **Closed as Not Planned** in favor of the
        consolidated or expanded Feature issue(s), as appropriate. Do not delete, mark as merge
        or split and **Closed as Not Planned**.
