        # The 3 Cs of Agile User Stories
        
        1. Select a User Card (imagine index cards, one color per user type).
        2. Describe in Conversation what this User would like to accomplish, with context, addressing concerns such as What and Why.
        3. Describe in simple list form (not checkboxes) Confirmation that we met those expectations as Acceptance Criteria.

        A user story is a description of what to do, a task (issue) in a related repository will describe implementation of
        a particular user story. Multiple tasks in multiple repositories may implement a user story or stories.
